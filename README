Aug Reality Cornell Cup Project ==
==================================

INTRODUCTION =
==============
This project aims to build an augmented reality simulator device
using a headset and the Intel DE2-i150 development board for the Cornell Cup
Competition. The headset is a custom design which has 3d graphics,
head tracking, gps positioning, and a wide field of view.
This is phase2 of the project. Documentation for phase1 and phase2 can be found
in our doc/ folder.
