This project contains the Cornell Cup headset power PCB code. It uses the STM32L100 series
microcontroller to establish an ultra-low-power method of correcting and reporting fuel gauge
data to the Intel Atom board.

You will need to have dfu-util 0.5 or later (http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/releases/) installed
on your PATH (put it in the yagarto bin directory to make sure).
