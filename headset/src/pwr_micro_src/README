This project contains the Cornell Cup headset power PCB code. It uses the STM32L100 series
microcontroller to establish an ultra-low-power method of correcting and reporting fuel gauge
data to the Intel Atom board.

You will need to install the STM32 ST-Link utility to enable "make upload" to autonomously
program the board through an ST-LINK dongle and SWD. Create a file named "stlink.mk" with the
only line being:

STLINK=C:/Program\ Files\ (x86)/STMicroelectronics/ST-LINK\ Utility

changed to match where the utility was actually installed on the local computer. Alternatively,
the ST-LINK GUI can be used instead, but note that the binary is only loaded when re-selected!

The "libSTMCore.a" is the STM32L Standard Peripherals Library pre-compiled for this chip
(STM32L1XX_MD), while "libSTMUSB.a" is the STM32 USB CDC-ACM example pre-compiled for this chip.
