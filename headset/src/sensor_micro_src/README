This project contains the Cornell Cup headset sensor PCB code. It is a derivative of the Senior
Design micro_src code, with the XBee and fuel gauge completely removed.

You will need to have dfu-util 0.5 or later (http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/releases/) installed
on your PATH (put it in the yagarto bin directory to make sure).
