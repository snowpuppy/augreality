The I2C driver here was written (by me) for the STM32F1 (LeafLabs Maple) and was ported with a
couple of lines changed.

It boots my STM32F4 discovery using Yagarto (http://sourceforge.net/projects/yagarto)
on windows arm-none-eabi-gcc 4.7.1:

You will need to install the ST-Link drivers and utility to get code onto the board. 
The stlink.mk file will need to be copied from "STM32Booter" and edited locally to point to the
right path.
