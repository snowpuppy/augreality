The files in this directory are a more or less straight pull of the STM example codes and
standard library, modified to boot this particular board. Much optimization can still be
performed. Looks to be capable of probably 10+ MFLOPS with careful optimizing.

It boots my STM32F4 discovery using Yagarto (http://sourceforge.net/projects/yagarto)
on windows arm-none-eabi-gcc 4.7.1:

You will need to install the ST-Link drivers and utility to get code onto the board. 
The stlink.mk file will need to be edited locally to point to the right path. Don't use
Windows 8 if avoidable, there are problems.
